# Base4Tone for kitty

The dark themes of [Base4Tone](https://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/base4tone) come included in kitty now.

In kitty do:

```bash
kitty +kitten themes
```

Follow instructions from within kitty to pick your favorite theme.

## Manual install
Maybe if you want to try some of the light themes, download or clone this repo and put it in the `~/.config/kitty/themes/` folder of [your favorite terminal emulator](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/).
Include the theme you want to try in the kitty configuration file `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` like so:

```sh
# BEGIN_KITTY_THEME
# include current-theme.conf
include themes/Base4Tone-kitty/themes/base4tone-classic-f-light.conf
```

## Base2Tone
More information on these colorschemes can be found at [atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/base4tone/](https://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/base4tone/)

## Templating
To be able to follow the guidelines from the [kitty-themes](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty-themes) repo - and thus to have some extra meta-data in comments in the theme files - a simple templating system with variables in PHP (with Curl) is used for generating the files. For the curious: those can be found in de `db` folder.
